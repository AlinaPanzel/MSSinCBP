% in this file, i spend some time staring at data points and thinking about
% how to deal with outliers

% conclusion from staring at 'sound' pattern: one person is identified as
% an outlier in change scores, whether looking within PLA or across all
% groups. Dropping that 1 person won't explain the overall pattern of
% placebo elevation at baseline. It looks like placebo simply really is
% elevated at baseline (not outlier-driven), and that there's a good deal
% of variability in data at pre and at post and in change scores.
% test-retest looks reasonable, and confirms the one outlier inflating
% placebo reductions. This one outlier could make a difference on a
% marginal p value but doesn't change overall pattern of change.

% conclusion from staring at 'general' pattern: there really are stable
% ind diffs, so seems risky/wrong to exclude ppl based on pre or post
% alone, as those might be "true" or near-true values. Better to exclude
% based on change scores. In change scores, i see one obvious outlier
% in UC, who has a likely-artifical large increase. If you account for
% this, you'll probably see *all* groups decreasing, instead of only PRT
% and PLA decreasing. So this will work against a PRT vs UC effect.

% staring at mPFC: outliers are exagerating a potential PRT vs UC effect

% staring at precuneus: relatively less impact of outliers, just 1, and its
% "working against" the potential PRT effect so removing will help
